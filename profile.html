        </center>
        <p>I am considering a part-time job to improve my time management skills and gain financial experience alongside
          my
          studies. In my free time, I enjoy playing DND and writing stories, nurturing my creativity. I'm also
          passionate about filmmaking and editing. Despite a long-term injury, I plan to continue personal fitness and
          recreational sports like basketball and volleyball. To merge these activities with my studies, I'll schedule
          dedicated time for work, hobbies, exercise, and filmmaking. This will help me excel academically while staying
          active, pursuing creative interests, and developing skills in filmmaking and editing.</p>
